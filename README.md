# Pokemon Infinite Fusion Calculator and Viewing Tool
A way to better visualize the fusion possibilities that I could use in my
playthroughs, in an organized, more user-friendly interface.

## Planning
- For a given mon, list all fusions in an organized, sortable table format.
- Allow sorting the table by:
  - IF dex number (default)
  - Name
  - Individual stats or stat total
- Allow filtering the table by:
  - Second mon (displays only the two fusions of the two mons)
  - Custom art
  - Type
  - Fully evolved only
