# Infinite Fusion Calculator and Search Tool
This tool provides a powerful way to search through and better visualize
possibilities for playthroughs of
[Pokemon Infinite Fusion](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=347883).
Results are presented in a straightforward but powerful table format and can be
both filtered and sorted against many relevant criteria. Emphasizes a clean,
intuitive, and organized UI free of most unnecessary clutter.

The project is written mostly in React/TypeScript; some portions (such as data
fetching) are done in vanilla JS for convenience.

## Contributing
The Infinite Fusion Search Tool is and always will be fully open-source. Please

bug reports, and the like.
